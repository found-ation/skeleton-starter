Free theme implementing Bootstrap 4.5

A free theme developed using Bootstrap 4.5. Skeleton has been primarily

use page builders. Skeleton accompanies the guide entitled Create a 
WordPress Theme, available from leemiller.club. Skeleton includes custom 
post types, which are implemented by way of a mu-plugin, available at the 
demo site.
