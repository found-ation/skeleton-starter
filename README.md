# skeleton-theme
Bootstrap 4.5 styles WordPress theme

Skeleton was created as a companion to the guide [Create a WordPress Theme](https://leemiller.club/documents/create-a-wordpress-theme-guide/), with the aim to help newcomers to WordPress create themes, rather than use page builders. You can view the demo on the [here](https://skeletontheme.club/).

When downloading this repo, note that the custom post type plugin is in the mu-plugin folder, so you'll need to move this folder to wp-content.

## Installation

Install in the usual manner, the easiest way is to move the files to the theme folder and activate in the admin dashboard. Otherwise upload and install using the WordPress theme manager - Appearance >> Themes

To install the plugins, move the entire mu-plugin folder to wp-content, or move the folder contents to an existing mu-plugins folder.

## Bugs /Issues

Still a little way to go before Skeleton is complete, it looks great, installs fine, but it's not perfect, certainly not at the stage where I'd submit to the WordPress Theme Directory. Any help from WP devs would be really appreciated.
